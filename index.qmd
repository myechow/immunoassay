### Product Introduction

Modern immunoassay labs expect IVD systems that behave like well-managed assets over their entire life cycle: a short “shake-out” phase, a long period of stable performance, and a controlled wear-out phase. In practice, many ELISA platforms never reach that stable, low-failure plateau because early manufacturing variation in temperature, pH, and optical density creates a spike of early defects and service calls—the classic “infant mortality” region of the bathtub curve. This project tackles that risk by integrating Pt100 Class A RTD sensors, structured SPC, and a digital twin into the ELISA manufacturing workflow so that critical-to-quality parameters (CTQs) such as temperature, pH, OD and defect rate are measured, trended, and acted on from the first validation lot onward.

Within a Quality 5.0 and Industry 4.0 mindset, the project treats data as the backbone of business process management. Real-time sensor data, batch-level defect statistics, and special-cause signals are used to shape decisions about process settings, maintenance, training, and release. My goal is to demonstrate that disciplined quality engineering—CTQ definition, SPC, reliability curves, and FMEA—can systematically push the process out of the “high early failure” region of the bathtub curve and into a predictable, low-risk operating mode. The work is structured like a formal project: clear charter and scope, defined stakeholders and responsibilities, transparent risk logic, and documented controls, so that a CQE could defend the strategy to both management and regulators with confidence.

### Key Controls in This Project

-   **SPC charts for CTQs**

    \[Statistical Process Control(SPC%20Charts.xlsx)\](SPC Charts.xlsx)

```         
-   Attribute charts for defects and defectives: **p, np, c, u.**

-   Variable charts for sensor and assay data: **X̄–R, X̄–S, I–MR.**
```

-   **Reliability analysis based on batch defectives**

```         
    -   Batch-wise failure rate derived from `n Inspected` and `Defectives (np).`

    -   Approximate reliability and bathtub-style curves over production “age”.
```

-   **FMEA summary by process step and special cause**

```         
-    Failure modes defined by `Process Step` and `Special Cause Type.`

-    Data-informed occurrence estimates; clear links to controls and monitoring.
```

-   **Risk score and CAPA trigger logic**

```         
-   Use of `Risk Score`, SPC signals, and anomaly flags to prioritize issues.

-   Explicit rules for when to recommend CAPA, escalation, or design/process review
```
