Overview of Comprehensive mock SOP of Smart Quality Integration in IVD Manufacturing

This Standard Operating Procedure outlines a regulatory-compliant framework for monitoring and validating the quality of ELISA-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturing using digital twin technology, RTD sensors, and IoT integration. It supports real-time tracking of temperature, pH, and optical density (OD) within smart, automated production environments.

The SOP is designed to ensure alignment with U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR Parts 820, 11, 801, 807, 830), ISO 13485, ISO 14971, and ASQ quality standards. It defines responsibilities across regulatory affairs, quality assurance, engineering, and documentation, and establishes validated procedures for risk-based monitoring, CAPA activation, and audit-readiness.

This document enables traceable, data-driven quality control, helping manufacturers uphold safety, compliance, and continuous improvement in global IVD operations.
