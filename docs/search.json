    "text": "1.1. Background of ELISA-Based In Vitro Diagnostics (IVDs)\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) form the cornerstone of modern disease detection, enabling clinicians to identify antigens, antibodies, and biomarkers in unfiltered blood and other biological samples (Wang & Costa, 2021). ELISA remains a benchmark technology for diagnosing infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, endocrine dysfunctions, and cancers due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Its applications span from detecting viral infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and COVID-19 to identifying auto-antibodies in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Type 1 diabetes (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020). In clinical laboratories and manufacturing environments, ELISA-based IVDs are essential to public health, as approximately 70% of clinical decisions rely on laboratory diagnostics, and immunoassay technologies account for over 40% of the U.S. IVD market share (Lopez & Singh, 2024).\n1.2. Mechanics of ELISA-Based IVD Systems\nThe ELISA assay operates by immobilizing antigen-antibody complexes on a microtiter plate surface, followed by binding of an enzyme-conjugated detection antibody and subsequent signal amplification via substrate conversion. Precise thermal control is crucial at every stage—from coating and blocking to incubation and colorimetric detection—since enzyme kinetics and antibody–antigen interactions are highly temperature-dependent (Smith & Thomas, 2021). Temperature fluctuations can induce enzyme denaturation or incomplete binding, leading to false-positive or false-negative results. Hence, temperature stability during ELISA processes is a critical quality determinant in IVD manufacturing (Patel & Nguyen, 2020).\n1.3. RTD Mechanics and Integration into ELISA-Based IVD Manufacturing\nResistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) are critical components in ensuring thermal stability during the manufacturing of ELISA-based in vitro diagnostics (IVDs). ELISA processes—such as antigen–antibody binding and enzyme-mediated colorimetric detection—are highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. RTDs address this need by providing accurate, stable, and repeatable temperature measurements, thereby improving consistency in assay performance and product quality.\nRTDs function based on the principle that the electrical resistance of a metal changes in a predictable manner with temperature. Platinum is the preferred material due to its linear resistance-temperature relationship, chemical stability, and high repeatability. The most commonly used RTD in regulated manufacturing is the Pt100 Class A, which has a resistance of 100 ohms at 0°C and offers an accuracy of ±0.15°C in compliance with IEC 60751 standards (Smith & Thomas, 2021). These sensors are passive devices and require a small excitation current, supplied by an external circuit, to enable resistance-based temperature measurement.\nTo support integration within modern smart manufacturing environments, RTDs are often embedded in IoT-enabled systems. In such architectures, the resistance reading from the RTD is converted to a standardized output—typically 4–20 mA, HART, or IO-Link—via a connected transmitter. This digital signal is then transmitted to edge gateways, cloud platforms, or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) for real-time analysis, traceability, and feedback control (Franco & Yoon, 2023).\nMultiple RTD configurations are employed depending on process requirements:\n\nImmersion Probes (Pt100): Stainless steel-sheathed probes for direct monitoring in incubators or bioreactors.\nRTD-Transmitter Units: Integrated electronics that allow factory calibration and direct communication with MES/QMS platforms.\nSurface-Mount RTDs: Flat foil or patch sensors used for external temperature monitoring on tubing or vessels.\nWireless RTDs: Battery-powered or energy-harvesting sensors communicating via ZigBee, LoRaWAN, or Wi-Fi, useful for retrofitting legacy systems or modular cleanrooms.\nWhen applied in ELISA manufacturing, RTDs enable closed-loop temperature control, improve compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485, and reduce assay variability. Their integration supports predictive maintenance, real-time process validation, and enhanced audit readiness—making them a foundational element of smart diagnostic device production under the Quality 5.0 paradigm.\n\n1.4.Importance of RTD-ELISA Integration\nPrior to the integration of Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) sensors, ELISA-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturing faced persistent challenges in quality consistency and process control. Traditional thermal regulation systems—typically reliant on thermocouples, thermostats, or manual monitoring—often introduced temperature variability during critical assay steps such as antigen–antibody binding and enzyme incubation. Such fluctuations affected enzyme kinetics and molecular binding efficiency, resulting in signal drift, false-positive or false-negative outcomes, and increased intra- and inter-assay variability. Consequently, these inconsistencies led to higher batch rejection rates, rework cycles, and deviations during quality control (Patel & Nguyen, 2020).\nIn addition to product variability, the absence of real-time temperature data limited the ability of manufacturers to ensure full traceability and predictive control, key requirements for ISO 13485 and FDA 21 CFR Part 820 compliance. Manual data recording and fragmented quality systems prevented continuous process verification, thus delaying Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) responses and inhibiting proactive decision-making. Moreover, the lack of integration between sensor data, digital batch records, and quality management dashboards restricted the scalability, reproducibility, and regulatory audit readiness of ELISA IVD production environments (Patel & Nguyen, 2020).\nThe introduction of RTD sensors within an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Quality 5.0 framework fundamentally transforms the ELISA manufacturing paradigm. RTDs, particularly GMP-validated Pt100 Class A models, offer high-precision thermal measurement (±0.15°C) and long-term stability that ensures the reproducibility of temperature-sensitive immunoassay reactions (Smith & Thomas, 2021). When coupled with IoT architectures, RTDs transmit real-time thermal data to digital twins and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), allowing continuous simulation and validation of process conditions (Lopez & Singh, 2024). This integration supports predictive anomaly detection, automated CAPA initiation, and data integrity management in compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 14971 risk-control standards (Smart Quality Integration Project Plan, 2025).\nThe Smart Quality Integration Process Map (2025) outlines this digital workflow: batch preparation and sensor calibration are followed by real-time data acquisition, anomaly detection, regulatory validation, and final batch release. Each step is digitally documented within MES and Quality Management Systems (QMS) for full traceability and audit readiness. This continuous feedback loop not only stabilizes ELISA thermal performance but also enhances regulatory compliance and process efficiency (Process Map, 2025).\nEmpirical implementation data demonstrate that merging RTD precision with ELISA-based IVD production results in measurable gains—batch yields above 99.5%, anomaly rates below 2%, and faster CAPA closure times—aligning directly with ISO 13485:2016 performance benchmarks and FDA audit-readiness expectations (Smith & Thomas, 2021; Patel & Nguyen, 2020). These improvements exemplify the practical application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Kaizen methodologies within the Quality 5.0 framework. Together, they create a culture of continual process optimization, waste reduction, and data-driven decision-making that reinforces both operational resilience and regulatory compliance.\nUltimately, the RTD–ELISA integration serves as a key enabler for the transition toward human-centric smart manufacturing in diagnostic device production—balancing automation with ethical oversight, precision with adaptability, and technological advancement with continuous quality improvement.\n1.5.Economic and Strategic Implications for the U.S. Market\nThe U.S. currently holds a dominant 40.1% share of the global ELISA-based IVD market, valued at approximately $980 million in 2024 and projected to reach $1.2 billion by 2034 (WHO, 2020). Integrating RTD-enabled smart manufacturing can yield substantial economic benefits by reducing production waste, improving quality yields, and ensuring faster market clearance for diagnostic devices (Kim & Duarte, 2022). These improvements translate directly into higher profitability, lower regulatory costs, and enhanced resilience in the domestic diagnostic supply chain. Moreover, implementing such Quality 5.0 systems would support job creation in advanced manufacturing, strengthen U.S. competitiveness in the global medical device sector, and reinforce the reliability of the healthcare system through improved diagnostic accuracy.\nThe stakeholder analysis indicates that this integration benefits all major roles in IVD manufacturing—from Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs to Executive Leadership and end users—by reducing defect rates, improving audit readiness, and increasing return on investment (Stakeholder Analysis, 2025). The combined ELISA–RTD–Quality 5.0 framework, therefore, not only enhances technical performance but also contributes significantly to the economic growth and sustainability of the U.S. diagnostic industry.\n\n\n\nFranco, M., & Yoon, S.

    "text": "Resistance Temperature Detector\nAn RTD is a passive sensor that does not generate its own signal.

In practice, many ELISA platforms never reach that stable, low-failure plateau because early manufacturing variation in temperature, pH, and optical density creates a spike of early defects and service calls—the classic “infant mortality” region of the bathtub curve. This project tackles that risk by integrating Pt100 Class A RTD sensors, structured SPC, and a digital twin into the ELISA manufacturing workflow so that critical-to-quality parameters (CTQs) such as temperature, pH, OD and defect rate are measured, trended, and acted on from the first validation lot onward.\nWithin a Quality 5.0 and Industry 4.0 mindset, the project treats data as the backbone of business process management. Real-time sensor data, batch-level defect statistics, and special-cause signals are used to shape decisions about process settings, maintenance, training, and release. My goal is to demonstrate that disciplined quality engineering—CTQ definition, SPC, reliability curves, and FMEA—can systematically push the process out of the “high early failure” region of the bathtub curve and into a predictable, low-risk operating mode. The work is structured like a formal project: clear charter and scope, defined stakeholders and responsibilities, transparent risk logic, and documented controls, so that a CQE could defend the strategy to both management and regulators with confidence.\n\n\nKey Controls in This Project\n\nSPC charts for CTQs\n[Statistical Process Control(SPC%20Charts.xlsx)](SPC Charts.xlsx)\n\n-   Attribute charts for defects and defectives: **p, np, c, u.**\n\n-   Variable charts for sensor and assay data: **X̄–R, X̄–S, I–MR.**\n\nReliability analysis based on batch defectives\n\n    -   Batch-wise failure rate derived from `n Inspected` and `Defectives (np).`\n\n    -   Approximate reliability and bathtub-style curves over production “age”.\n\nFMEA summary by process step and special cause\n\n-    Failure modes defined by `Process Step` and `Special Cause Type.`\n\n-    Data-informed occurrence estimates; clear links to controls and monitoring.\n\nRisk score and CAPA trigger logic\n\n-   Use of `Risk Score`, SPC signals, and anomaly flags to prioritize issues.\n\n-   Explicit rules for when to recommend CAPA, escalation, or design/process review\n\n\n\nR Shiny App for SPC Visualization\nShiny App"
