## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

**Title:** Comprehensive SOP – Smart Quality Integration and Immunoassay Batch Monitoring

**SOP ID**: COMP-SOP-2025

**Effective Date**: 18DEC2025.

**Digital Quality Systems and Technical Writing Reviewed and Approved By**: MCI. Version: 1.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.0 Background

This SOP defines a unified framework for smart quality control and immunoassay batch monitoring using RTD sensors, IoT-enabled infrastructure, and digital twins in a regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturing setting. It supports ELISA-based assays used in clinical detection of proinflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 and TNF-α. The devices are FDA-cleared under 510(k), CE-marked under IVDR, and distributed internationally.

### 2.0 Purpose

To ensure regulatory-aligned, real-time quality monitoring of IVD production using automated sensing, data validation, and digital risk control systems. This SOP is designed to comply with FDA (21 CFR Part 820, 11, 801, 807, 830), ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2019, and ASQ quality principles.

### 3.0 Scope

Applies to U.S.-based manufacturing operations of ELISA-based IVD devices utilizing digital twin simulations, GMP-compliant RTD sensors, MES platforms, and audit-ready documentation practices. Covers regulatory, engineering, and QA documentation roles.

### 4.0 Responsibilities

• Regulatory Affairs: Maintain regulatory filings, compliance matrices, UDI, and labeling controls. • Quality Assurance: Execute validation, risk management, CAPA, and internal audit processes. • Engineering: Implement RTD and sensor technologies into production workflows. • IT/Data Governance: Ensure secure, auditable data flows and version tracking. • Documentation: Create, control, and update technical and training materials.

### 5.0 Digital Twin and IoT Integration

Real-time bioreactor environments are monitored with Pt100 Class A RTDs (±0.15°C), auto-calibrated pH probes, and photo-optical OD sensors. Data is encrypted and streamed via MQTT/TLS to MES, processed through edge gateways, and stored in validated 21 CFR Part 11-compliant systems. This supports anomaly detection, automated alerts, traceability, and early-stage deviation control.

### 6.0 Procedure Overview

• Continuously monitor temperature, pH, and OD from ELISA batch reactors using validated RTDs and sensors. • Sync sensor data with MES using secure IoT protocols for time-stamped audit logging. • Trigger anomaly detection and CAPA initiation when risk thresholds are breached. • Use digital twins to simulate manufacturing environments for validation and predictive maintenance. • Store records and technical files in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485 traceability principles.

### 7.0 Regulatory Compliance Matrix

• 21 CFR Part 820: Design controls, process validation, device history records, CAPA • 21 CFR Part 11: Electronic records, signatures, audit trails • 21 CFR Part 801: Device labeling and traceability • 21 CFR Part 807: Device registration and listing • 21 CFR Part 830: Unique Device Identification (UDI) • ISO 9001:2015: Quality improvement, risk-based process management • ISO 13485:2016: QMS for medical devices and technical documentation • ISO 14971:2019: Risk management for safety and effectiveness • ASQ principles: Continuous improvement, defect prevention, process capability

### 8.0 Deliverables and Validation

• SOPs and QMS documentation aligned with U.S. and international regulations • Fully traceable, editable batch and sensor records • Risk scoring dashboards and alert systems for deviation control • Integration of sensor data with MES/QMS for digital audit readiness • Validated documentation workflows for FDA and ISO audits
