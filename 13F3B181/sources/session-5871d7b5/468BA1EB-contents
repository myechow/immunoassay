### Resistance Temperature Detector

An RTD is a passive sensor that does not generate its own signal. It requires an external circuit to pass a small current through it to measure its resistance, which is then converted into a temperature reading. In the context of Industry 4.0, RTDs are often integrated with transmitters that convert the resistance measurement into a digital or standardized signal, such as 4-20 mA. This functionality allows RTDs to operate as smart sensors, making them easily usable in control systems and the Internet of Things (IoT).

RTDs are appreciated for their high precision, accuracy, stability, and repeatability across a moderate temperature range. By providing reliable temperature data, RTDs are essential for "smart" applications in smart manufacturing, including process optimization, predictive maintenance, and enhanced product quality. These applications are core concepts of Industry 4.0.

### Real-World Use Case: RTDs in ELISA Manufacturing:

1.  Process: Monitoring thermal incubation chambers (37°C ± 0.5°C).
2.  RTD Type: GMP-validated Pt100 probe with HART interface.
3.  IoT Output: Sent to digital twin for real-time control and risk flagging.
4.  Compliance: Meets FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ISO 13485, and Annex XI of IVDR.
